About Me

I'm a Computer Science student studying at National Institute Of Technology, Trichy. I am a native of West Bengal. However, I did my schooling in Jamshedpur till 7th grade. The remaining schooling years were done at Chennai.

My Favourites

I follow football and a fan of Chelsea F.C. Apart from watching football, I also spend time listening to music. I currently listen to a lot of EDM and like to create playlists for different moods. I am a TV Show critic and indulge in a lot binge watching sessions. Apart from this I am also an amateur Beatboxer.
